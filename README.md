## Meet Elixa
[Elixa Newpal](http://www.elixa.io/) is a beginning software engineering student with a passion for helping her fellow bootcampers debug their code.  While she doesn't have much hands-on technical experience, she has picked up some programming tips, especially when it comes to common rookie mistakes in Ruby, Rails or Javascript.  Even when her suggestions are not exactly on point, sometimes just chatting through troubleshooting woes can help.  Elixa figures she as least as good of a troubleshooting partner as a [rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).  And when a bug has you really stuck, what have you got to lose?

Elixa's friendly attitude, familiar Slack-like interface, and constant availability makes her an appealing option for anyone who needs to chat through a thorny coding problem.  Her technical tips are based on the learning experiences of many software bootcamp students and instructors. Elixa's advice includes targeted responses at the mention of specific technologies, as well as general programming wisdom.  And if the conversation strays off the topic of programming, she may slip into interactions based on her previous career as a psychotherapist!

## Historic Inspiration

Elixa Newpal is based on ELIZA, an early natural language processing computer program developed in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. ELIZA simulated conversation by using a pattern matching and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program. Interactions were dictated by "scripts" which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a psychotherapist by using script rules to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. ELIZA was one of the first ever chatbots and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test.

ELIZA was originally written in the MAD-SLIP programming language, which Weizenbaum invented as a an extension to FORTRAN.  In 1977, a BASIC version appeared in Creative Computing magazine, which was ported to many of the earliest personal computers of the late 70s and early 80s. ELIZA continues to be source of inspiration for programmers and developers focused on artificial intelligence.  For example, Amazon's Alexa includes an [ELIZA implementation](https://www.amazon.com/Asimov-Eliza/dp/B0184NR4P8) as does [Google Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-home-commands-cheat-sheet/).  Another version of Eliza popular among software engineers is the version that comes with the default release of GNU Emacs, and which can be accessed by typing `M-x doctor` from most modern Emacs implementations.

The Elixa Newpal code is based on a 2005 [ELIZA Javascript implementation](https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) by [Norbert Landsteiner of mass:werk media](https://www.masswerk.at/). While being a mere 15 years old as opposed to 55, this ELIZA uses a web interface that is styled similar to a teletype in order to mimic the original 1966 version. Elixa uses the same chatbot engine code as the Landsteiner implementation, but with an updated interface to provide a slack-like experience, and with a new script that reimagines her as a beginning SE bootcamp student rather than a Rogerian therapist.

## Modern Inspiration

Elixa Newpal was developed as an appreciative gift to the incredible learning community of the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp in Denver, CO, affectionately known as "The Love Bubble" or "The Learning Factory".  

## Technologies

**Frontend**
* Implemented in Javascript
* Deployed with [Netlify](https://netlify.app/)
* Frontend repo: https://github.com/tara-m-harwood/elixa-newpal-fe

**Backend**
* Node.js and Express
* Deployed with [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
* Backend repo: https://github.com/tara-m-harwood/elixa-newpal-node

## Status and Future Plans

2021-04-02: Elixa Newpal was launched as an MVP and presented to the Denver Love Bubble community.

Future features under consideration:
* Creation of a new general-purpose Elixa script for troublshooting support, broadening beyond one specific school
* Improvment of the keyword memory feature so that Elixa will "remember" specific technologies mentioned earlier in the conversation and be able to persist some context
* Addition of an autosearch feature where Elixa will present the user with Google searches based on combinations of keywords
* An SMS interface
* An official Slackbot integration
* A significant refactor of the code

## Contact

Hi! My name is Tara Harwood, and I am the developer of Elixa Newpal and the Founder/ Chief Hobbyist of [elixa.io](https://elixa.io/), which is my brand for volunteer contributions to open-source projects and chatbot research activities.  I have a specific interest in natural language processing, SMS applications, and technologies related to political activism.

As a child, my first personal computer came with the BASIC version of ELIZA, and from the start I was entranced with her.  My early positive experiences with ELIZA formed my interest in computer programming and influenced my ideas about interaction design.

As of April 2021, I am a student at Flatiron School's Full-Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp in Denver, CO. I created Elixa Newpal as my Week 9 project, as part of my 15 week curriculum. I will be graduating in May 2021. You can learn more about / contact me on LinkedIn or GitHub:
